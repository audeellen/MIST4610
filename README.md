## Problem description
For this project, we needed to create a relational database for a hypothetical sports team called the “Georgia Thunderhawks”. There are numerous entities involved within the Georgia Thunderhawks that allow it to operate and remain organized. These entities include but are not limited to staff, players, sponsors, and plays. The Georgia Thunderhawks collects data on these entities. As a group, we are interested in analyzing the relationship between these entities. To do so, we created a data model and then created a database based on the completed data model. To efficiently analyze the relationship between entities with the Georgia Thunderhawks, we are interested in creating insightful queries that would allow the manager of the Georgia Thunderhawks team to make great business decisions.
